# Future Star — Football Talent Prediction

**Future Star** is a data-driven machine learning project that predicts whether a young football player has the potential to become a *Future Star*.  
Developed as part of the **Saudi Digital Academy Bootcamp in partnership with Le Wagon.** in Riyadh, it focuses on supporting **Saudi football academies** and aligns with the country’s **Vision 2030** goals for sports innovation.

## 🌍 Project Overview

Scouting talented players often relies on subjective judgment and limited exposure.  
**Future Star** introduces an objective way to assess youth players by analyzing detailed match statistics — from goals and assists to defensive and progressive actions — to generate a *Future Star probability score*.

The project’s goal is to help clubs and academies spot hidden talent early and make data-driven decisions.

## ⚙️ Core Concept

- Focused on **Saudi youth players** with potential to expand globally  
- Uses **advanced performance metrics** such as:
  - Goals & Assists per 90 minutes  
  - Expected Goals (xG) & Expected Assists (xA)  
  - Defensive actions, blocks, clearances  
  - Progressive passes and passing accuracy  
- Compares players fairly within their position (GK, DF, MF, FW)  
- Produces an interpretable probability score showing how close a player is to becoming a *Future Star*

## 🧠 Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation** – transforming raw match data into comparable per-90 features  
2. **Feature Engineering** – deriving advanced metrics that better represent player performance  
3. **Modeling** – training and optimizing an XGBoost classifier with SMOTE and OneHot Encoding  
4. **Evaluation** – assessing model accuracy & interpretability  
5. **Deployment** – FastAPI service containerized with Docker and hosted on **Google Cloud Run**
